üëã **Welcome to my GitHub!**

I am a Master of Science graduate in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Computer Vision and Robotics from the University of Washington, Seattle. My passion lies in leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in the field of autonomous systems and drones.

### üåü About Me

üî¨ **Research Assistant, UW - Autonomous Flight Systems Lab**

Under the guidance of Prof. Karen Leung, I had the incredible opportunity to lead a team working on BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) UAV systems tailored for wilderness search and rescue missions. Our project involved:

- **BVLOS UAV Systems:** Developing and deploying autonomous drones capable of operating beyond the visual line of sight to enhance search and rescue operations in challenging terrains.
- **Vision Algorithms:** Implementing state-of-the-art vision algorithms for object detection and identification, enabling drones to locate and identify targets in vast wilderness areas.
- **Path Planning:** Creating robust path planning algorithms to ensure efficient and safe navigation of UAVs through unpredictable environments.
- **Pipeline Deployment:** Successfully deploying a comprehensive pipeline that integrates vision and path planning algorithms, ensuring seamless operation during flight tests.

Our work culminated in the publication of a research paper in AIAA Scitech 2024, showcasing our advancements and findings. You can read more about it [paper](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2024-1695). Additionally, we conducted extensive flight testing to validate our system's performance, which you can watch [flight testing](https://www.youtube.com/@UWControlandTrustworthyR-nc8km).
